| Element | Element | Deliverable or process. |
| Deliverable | Deliverable | Deliverables such as documents and programs. Also includes intangible things like mental understanding. Represented by rectangles. |
| Process | Process | Something that takes deliverables as input and produces deliverables as output. Represented by ovals. A process is either an atomic process or a composite process. |
| Atomic process | Atomic process | The smallest unit of work that cannot be decomposed further. The oval border is a single line. |
| Composite process | Composite process | A collection of atomic processes. The oval border is a double line. |
| Context diagram | Context diagram | A PFD where the entire process is treated as a composite process. That is, initial deliverables, final deliverables, and only one composite process are arranged. |
| Edge | Edge | A solid arrow connecting deliverables to processes or processes to deliverables. An edge from a deliverable to a process means that the deliverable is used by the process. An edge from a process to a deliverable means that the process creates the deliverable. |
| Feedback edge | Feedback edge | A dashed arrow connecting a deliverable to a process. The process at the end of the feedback edge can be executed multiple times; it cannot use the deliverable at the source of the feedback edge on the first run, but can use it from the second run onwards. |
| Feedback loop | Feedback loop | Among cycles that include feedback edges, those where the same element does not appear in the cycle. |
| Input deliverables | Input deliverables | Deliverables used by a process. Input deliverables do not include resources. For an atomic process, it is the deliverable that has an edge to that atomic process. For a composite process, it is the deliverable in the union of input deliverable sets of all atomic processes contained within, that is not created by any of the contained atomic processes. |
| Output deliverable | Output deliverable | A deliverable created by a process. For an atomic process, it is the deliverable that has an edge from that atomic process. For a composite process, it is the output deliverable of any of the contained atomic processes. |
| Initial deliverable | Initial deliverable | A deliverable in the PFD that is not created by any process. |
| Intermediate deliverable | Intermediate deliverable | A deliverable in the PFD that is neither an initial deliverable nor a final deliverable. |
| Final deliverables | Final deliverables | A deliverable in the PFD that is not used by any process. |
| Element tables | Element tables | A set of process table, deliverable table, and composite process table. If the composite process table is empty, it may be omitted. |
| Deliverable table | Deliverable table | A table consisting of deliverable IDs and their descriptions. |
| Process table | Process table | A table consisting of process IDs and their descriptions. |
| Composite process table | Composite process table | A table consisting of rows of composite process IDs and the process IDs contained in them. The composite process consisting of the entire process set corresponding to the context diagram is obvious and therefore not listed. |
| Feasibility | Feasibility | If the scheduled worker can be confident that they can create output deliverables from input deliverables for a process, it is feasible. Otherwise, it is infeasible. |
| Execution Model | Execution Model | A model for defining process executability and calculating process execution plans from PFD. |
| Execution | Execution | The creation of output deliverables of a process. Processes are not always executable. |
| Time | Time | A floating-point number representing time in the execution model. Time 1 represents 1 business day, and the decimal part represents business hours within the business day with the decimal part rounded up. For example, with business hours of 09:00-18:00, time 1.5 represents 13:30 on the second business day. |
| Executability | Executability | The property of whether a process can be executed or not. The definition differs for each execution model. |
| Execution plan | Execution plan | A set of pairs of time intervals and processes. The pair means that the process is executed within the time interval. It can be represented by a Gantt chart. |
| Lead time | Lead time | The time it takes from starting a process to completing the output deliverable. |
| Resource | Resource | Something that can be used by any process and requires exclusive occupation during execution. For example, workers and equipment. |
| Available time of initial deliverables | Available time of initial deliverables | The time when initial deliverables become available. At times before this time, this deliverable is treated as non-existent. |
| Volume of work | Volume of work | The amount of work required from starting to completing an atomic process. |
| Remained volume of work | Remained volume of work | The amount of remaining work required until completion of an atomic process in the current state. |
| IDAP (Immediately done atomic process) | IDAP; Immediately done atomic process | An atomic process with a remaining work volume of 0. |
| IDAP set | IDAP set | A set of IDAPs that are completed in a certain state. The limit of the recurrence relation `f(n) = (if n = 0 then {ap. input deliverable set excluding feedback edges(ap) ⊆ deliverable set with version updates in the immediately preceding state ∧ is IDAP(ap)} else {ap. input deliverable set excluding feedback edges(ap) ⊆ (⋃ (image output deliverable set (f(n))) ∪ deliverable set with version updates in the immediately preceding state) ∧ is IDAP(ap)})` as `n→∞`. |
| Revision | Revision | The number of times a deliverable has been created or modified. 0 means the deliverable has not been created. |
| SM (Single deliverables execution model) | SM; Single deliverables execution model | An execution model where each deliverable is only one. The execution model is further divided by the finiteness of resources: FSM if resources are finite, ISM if infinite. |
| MM (Multiple deliverables execution model) | MM; Multiple deliverables execution model | An execution model where each deliverable can have multiple instances. Corresponds to Value Stream Mapping. Not handled in this project. |
| ISM (Infinite resources single deliverables execution model) | ISM; Infinite resources single deliverables execution model | A single deliverable execution model where resources are considered unlimited and there are no restrictions on available resources. The simplest model corresponding to PERT if there are no feedback edges. Being simple, it helps understand execution models. Also suitable for rough estimation since estimates can be made without interviewing process executors. However, since resources are finite in reality, it may generate execution plans that cannot actually be executed due to resource constraints. |
| Critical path | Critical path | See the definition of critical path in PERT. |
| FSM (Finite resources single deliverables execution model) | FSM; Finite resources single deliverables execution model | A single deliverable execution model where resources are finite and an atomic process can be executed if it can occupy the resources necessary for its execution. High estimation accuracy because it can generate execution plans that reflect real resource situations. Not suitable for rough estimates as determining resources and consumed work volume requires cost and time for estimation. |
| FSM allocation | FSM allocation | A partial function from atomic processes to allocation elements. All allocations must satisfy the following conditions: (1) All atomic processes with defined allocation elements are executable, (2) For any distinct executable atomic processes ap1 and ap2, the resource set of ap1's allocation element and the resource set of ap2's allocation element are disjoint. |
| FSM allocation element | FSM allocation element | A pair of resource set and consumed work volume. |
| FSM allocatability | FSM allocatability | Whether resources can be allocated to an atomic process if resources can be occupied. An atomic process is allocatable if it meets any of the following conditions: (1) Continuing execution, (2) The atomic process has all input deliverables generated, has at least one input deliverable that has been updated but not yet processed, has non-zero remaining work volume, and meets start conditions. Otherwise it is non-allocatable. |
| FSM executability | FSM executability | Whether an atomic process can be executed when resources are allocated to it. For atomic process ap, if all input deliverables have a version of 1 or more and there are version updates to input deliverables that have not yet been processed by ap, then ap is executable. Otherwise it is not executable. |
| FSM state | FSM state | A 7-tuple representing one execution situation in FSM: (1) time, (2) function from deliverable to version, (3) function from atomic process to remaining work volume, (4) completion count from atomic process to that atomic process, (5) loop count from atomic process starting from that atomic process to feedback source deliverable, (6) function to set of atomic processes that have not yet executed based on post-update version for each version-updated deliverable with this deliverable as input, (7) allocation to continue execution. Execution state starts from one initial state, progresses through state transitions, and eventually reaches a completed state. |
| Initial state | Initial state | The initial execution state. Let A be the immediately done atomic process simultaneous completion set when initial deliverables available at time 0 are treated as updated deliverables, and let D be the union of output deliverable sets of each element in A. The initial state satisfies: (1) time 0, (2) versions of initial deliverables available at time 0 and elements of D are all 1, other versions are 0, (3) remaining work volume of atomic processes is initial work volume, (4) completion count of atomic processes is 1 only for elements of A, 0 otherwise, (5) feedback loop count is 0 for all atomic processes, (6) for version-updated deliverables being the union of deliverables available at time 0 and D, only atomic processes that take each as input and are not included in A have not processed the update, (7) allocation to continue execution is empty allocation. The initial state is uniquely determined for environments that satisfy invariant conditions. |
| Completed state | Completed state | A state where execution is completed. The current time is greater than or equal to the maximum available time of all deliverables, and there are no allocatable atomic processes. |
